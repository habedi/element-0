A small embeddable Lisp for the Zig ecosystem Î»

</div>

---

Element 0 is a Lisp dialect implemented in the Zig programming language.
It is inspired by Scheme and aims to be compliant with
the [R5RS](https://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/fp/Bigloo/doc/r5rs-7.html) standard to a good degree, but not limited to it.

This project provides a lightweight, embeddable interpreter (named `Elz`) for Element 0.
Elz can be easily integrated into Zig applications as a scripting engine, as well as a standalone interactive
read-eval-print-loop (REPL).
Additionally, it comes with a foreign function interface (FFI) API that lets you call Zig procedures from Element 0 and
vice versa.

### Features

* A good level of R5RS compliance with a sizable standard library (see [std.elz](src/stdlib/std.elz)).
* Easy to integrate into Zig projects as a lightweight and fast scripting engine.
* Easy to extend with Zig functions via FFI.
* Comes with REPL for scripting and development.

See the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the list of implemented and planned features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Element 0 is in early development, so bugs and breaking changes are expected.
> Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/habedi/element-0/issues) to report bugs or request features.

### Getting Started

Element 0 is implemented in Zig 0.14.1 and needs at least Zig 0.14.1 to build.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/habedi/element-0.git
   cd element-0
   ```
2. Build and run the REPL:
   ```sh
   zig build repl
   ```

### Documentation

You can find the full API documentation for the latest release of Element 0 [here](https://habedi.github.io/element-0/).

Alternatively, you can use the `make docs` command to generate the API documentation for the current version of
Element 0 from the source code.
This will generate HTML documentation in the `docs/api` directory, which you can serve locally with `make serve-docs`
and view in your web browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Examples

Check out the [examples](examples/) directory for various usage examples,
including both Element 0 code and Zig FFI examples.
