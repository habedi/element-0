/*
 * This file could be used for the following purposes:
 *   - get the complete collector as a single link object file (module);
 *   - enable more compiler optimizations.
 *
 * Tip: to get the highest level of compiler optimizations, the typical
 * compiler options to use (assuming gcc) are:
 * `-O3 -march=native -fprofile-generate`
 *
 * Warning: gcc for Linux (for C++ clients only): use `-fexceptions` both for
 * the collector library and the client as otherwise `GC_thread_exit_proc()`
 * is not guaranteed to be invoked (see the comments in `pthread_start.c`
 * file).
